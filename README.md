# Elementum App

Welcome to **Elementum App**, an open-source project aimed at creating modular and reusable web components using a dynamic, constraint-based layout system. This project lays the groundwork for building scalable and flexible web UIs inspired by the precision and adaptability of frameworks like **Android Studio's ConstraintLayout** and modern utility-based CSS systems.

> **Note:** This repository is in its early conceptual stage and does not contain any code yet. Your contributions and feedback are essential in shaping the direction of this project.

## Project Inspiration

**Elementum App** is inspired by the need for a flexible and precise UI component builder that bridges the gap between design and development. Drawing from the capabilities of Android Studio's **ConstraintLayout** and utility-based CSS systems like **Tailwind CSS**, Elementum aims to offer a data-driven, constraint-based layout system for building dynamic components.

We took inspiration from several open-source projects and UI layout frameworks, striving to combine the best aspects of these tools into a single cohesive system.

## Vision

**Elementum App** aims to provide:

- A **dynamic layout builder** with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Constraint-based layouts** for precise and scalable designs.
- **Utility-first styling** that generates scoped CSS classes dynamically.
- A **data-driven component system** for rendering layouts based on real-time inputs.

## Current Status

This project is currently at an **initial planning stage**. We are focusing on architectural design and gathering community feedback to set a clear development path.

## Contribution

We encourage contributions from developers, designers, and enthusiasts who are passionate about building a robust and adaptable UI component system. Your ideas and input are crucial for refining **Elementum App**!
